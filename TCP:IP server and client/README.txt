This is a TCP server and client implementation.

The data between the server and client are exchanged via byte stream and unit test cases are written to check the correctness of the code.

4 operations are possible from client side which are

List files on server.
Read/Write files onto server.
Delete files from server.

Used junit to test all the four functionality.

Finally implemented to send and write java objects on the server.
